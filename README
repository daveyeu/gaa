Presenting Gnome Autotest Applet (gaa).

This places a small status icon in your Gnome toolbar that let's you know how
your autotest is doing.  Green -- good.  Red -- not so good.  Inspired by
autotest/emacs.

What's autotest?  Go here: http://rubyforge.org/projects/zentest/

== Installation ==

1. Install Ruby-GNOME2 and Ruby D-Bus:
    * http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/
    * https://trac.luon.net/ruby-dbus/

   Ruby-GNOME2 is available as an Ubuntu package, but as of Feisty it's an
   older version that won't work.

2. Load up "lib/autotest/gaa.rb" in your ~/.autotest file.

   I used an absolute path, so something like:
       require '/home/dave/lib/autotest/gaa'

3. Startup the status icon -- "bin/gaa".

   You _could_ run it by hand before running autotest.  But that's not the
   recommended way.

   Instead, add it to your session so that it's automatically run upon
   login.  Snazzy.  On Ubuntu Feisty, System > Preferences > Sessions gets
   you halfway there.
